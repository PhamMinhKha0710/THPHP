# Project Structure

This PHP web application follows an MVC-like architecture with clear separation between backend and frontend components.

## Directory Structure Overview

### Backend Components
- **Models**: [app/models](mdc:app/models) - Backend business logic and data access
  - Example: [AccountModel.php](mdc:app/models/AccountModel.php) - Handles account data operations
- **Controllers**: [app/controllers](mdc:app/controllers) - Request handling and application flow
  - Example: [AccountController.php](mdc:app/controllers/AccountController.php) - Processes account-related actions
- **Configuration**: [app/config](mdc:app/config) - Application configuration including database settings

### Frontend Components
- **Views**: [app/views](mdc:app/views) - HTML templates and presentation layer
  - **Account Views**: [app/views/Account](mdc:app/views/Account) - User account interface
    - [login.php](mdc:app/views/Account/login.php) - Login form
    - [register.php](mdc:app/views/Account/register.php) - Registration form
    - [profile.php](mdc:app/views/Account/profile.php) - User profile display
    - [edit.php](mdc:app/views/Account/edit.php) - Profile editing form
    - [changePassword.php](mdc:app/views/Account/changePassword.php) - Password change form
  - **Shared Components**: [app/views/shares](mdc:app/views/shares) - Reusable UI elements
    - [header.php](mdc:app/views/shares/header.php) - Common page header
    - [footer.php](mdc:app/views/shares/footer.php) - Common page footer
- **Assets**: [public](mdc:public) - Public assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images

## Application Flow
1. User requests are received by [index.php](mdc:index.php) at the application root
2. The routing system determines the appropriate controller and action
3. Controllers process the request, interact with models, and pass data to views
4. Views render the HTML output which is returned to the user

## Development Approach
- Backend developers focus on models, controllers, and business logic
- Frontend developers focus on views, CSS, JavaScript, and user experience
