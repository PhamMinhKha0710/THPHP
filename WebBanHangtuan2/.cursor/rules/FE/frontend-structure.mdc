# Frontend Structure

This application follows a structured approach to frontend organization:

## View Structure
- Views are located in [app/views](mdc:app/views)
- Shared components like headers and footers are in [app/views/shares](mdc:app/views/shares)
- Feature-specific views are organized in dedicated folders (e.g., [app/views/Account](mdc:app/views/Account))

## Key Frontend Components
- **Header**: [header.php](mdc:app/views/shares/header.php) - Contains navigation, search, and user account controls
- **Footer**: [footer.php](mdc:app/views/shares/footer.php) - Contains site information, links, and JavaScript includes

## Page Structure
Each page follows a consistent structure:
1. Include the header
2. Main content with consistent container classes
3. Include the footer

Example from [profile.php](mdc:app/views/Account/profile.php):
```php
<?php
require_once 'app/views/shares/header.php';
?>

<div class="container py-5">
    <!-- Page content -->
</div>

<?php
require_once 'app/views/shares/footer.php';
?>
